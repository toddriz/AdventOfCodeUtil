### Project for working through the Advent of Code programming puzzles

---

Step 1 - paste your AoC session cookie into the adventCookie variable in the utils.js file.

Step 2 - run 'npm run setup YEAR', with the year you are solving, it defaults to current year. That will download all available input files and create a skeleton js file where you can solve each puzzle.

Step 3 - solve the puzzle.

Step 4 - run 'npm run YEAR LEVEL SHOULDSUBMITANSWER' with the year, level, and a boolean indicating whether you want the code to submit the answer automatically.
